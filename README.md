## Open Ophthalmoscope

This project is a replication of the Open Indirect Ophthalmoscope (OIO) project. Our aim is to develop a low-cost hardware solution to capture retinal fundus images which is used for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, we also provide the software for automatically diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from the captured fundus images.   

This projects includes both hardware and software components.
